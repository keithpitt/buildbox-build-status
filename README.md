# Buildbox Build Status

This is a super lo-fi, Heroku-able (Totally a verb, shut up) build server indicator. It doesn't need anything other than a browser.

## Setup

Clone, then make a copy of ```public/settings.example.js``` and fill you buildbox project name and API key. It will automatically enumerate all your builds in the project.

## Running

Put the stuff in public on a webserver, and hit the server. All done.

Otherwise, create a Heroku site and push it. It should just work(tm).
